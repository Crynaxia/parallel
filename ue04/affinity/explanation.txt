there are 3 proc_bind modes

master
    uses only 1 core for every thread
    times
    work took 3.720352 seconds
    work took 3.764887 seconds
    work took 3.735059 seconds
    work took 3.714193 seconds

close
    uses multiple cores on the same partition and spreads them equally
    times
    work took 3.82574 seconds
    work took 3.719461 seconds
    work took 3.699492 seconds
    work took 3.696984 seconds

spread
    spreads threads equally over partitions
    times:
    work took 3.683110 seconds
    work took 3.749659 seconds
    work took 3.703161 seconds
    work took 3.752561 seconds

    the time differences are very marginal
    could be because atomic makes a bottleneck and does not allow for
    good parallisation, but with reduction the time was way to small
    except with nested for loops.
